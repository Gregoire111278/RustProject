# 0003 - Use Thread Pool for Robot Concurrency

## Status
Proposed

## Context

As the number of robots in the simulation increases, the cost of sequentially processing each robotâ€™s logic per tick becomes noticeable. Especially with more complex modules (e.g., scanning, smart movement, reporting), performance becomes a concern.

We considered multiple models for handling concurrency:
- Spawning a thread per robot (overhead, unsustainable for many robots)
- Keeping it sequential (simpler, but slower)
- Using async runtimes (requires significant refactor)
- Using a thread pool

## Decision

We propose using a **fixed-size thread pool** to distribute robot logic execution in parallel:
- A worker pool handles robot tick logic (movement, scanning, collection)
- Results are sent back to the main simulation loop for state updates
- We can use `rayon`, `crossbeam`, or a custom thread pool implementation

This parallelizes robot operations while avoiding the cost of spawning threads on each tick.

## Consequences

### Pros:
- Scalable execution model for large swarms
- Reuses threads efficiently
- Improves tick performance as robot count increases
- Easier to manage than per-thread robots

### Cons:
- Adds complexity around synchronization and shared state (e.g., map, logs)
- May require `Arc<Mutex<>>` patterns or message passing for safety
- Debugging becomes harder due to non-deterministic execution order

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Per-thread-per-robot
- Simple in concept, but extremely heavy on system resources

### 2. Async (e.g., `tokio`, `async-std`)
- Very powerful, but would require refactoring large parts of the simulation engine
- Overhead not justified for simple per-tick logic

### 3. Keep it fully sequential
- Easier to test/debug
- Not scalable for large maps or many robots

## Related Decisions
- ADR 0001: Message passing with `mpsc`
- TBD: robot-to-robot interaction via messages vs shared state

## Notes
Thread pools provide a practical balance of performance and simplicity for this stage. Should the simulation grow in complexity (e.g., real-time rendering, hundreds of agents), migration to async may be reconsidered.
